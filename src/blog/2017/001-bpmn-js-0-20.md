<p class="introduction">
  We are happy to announce the latest release of our [BPMN modeler / toolkit](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js). With this release it's possible to not only copy and paste elements but also their implementation details. Furthermore, we improved the modeling experience for BPMN and DMN.
</p>

## Copy BPMN Implementation Details

In this release we completed the implementation of copying and pasting elements. Their BPMN and [Camunda](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.6/reference/bpmn20/custom-extensions/) implementation details are now copied, too. Check out the latest [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/) to see this in action.

## Attaching and Detaching the Modeler

Thanks to a [contribution](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/commit/6dc4af53969825ae0122bf06e3964d74adfa1cc3) from the community it's now possible to attach or detach the viewer to an element on the page.

```javascript
var viewer = new BpmnViewer();

// attach it to some element
viewer.attachTo('#container');

// detach the panel
viewer.detach();
```

## Modeling Improvements

You are now able to drag elements onto sequence flows not only when you're creating a new element but also when you're moving an existing one.

<div class="figure">
  <a href="http://demo.bpmn.io/">
    <img src="{{ assets }}/attachments/blog/2017/001-move-onto-sequence-flow.gif">
  </a>
</div>

Furthermore, we improved the way we render labels thereby being able to fix a couple of related bugs.

## What's Next?

We do not have anything concrete on our roadmap. Anything you are missing? Approach us [on our forums](https://forum.bpmn.io) and tell us what you think about the latest features.
